    "The first step involves reading and processing the data from the CSV file. We initialize dictionaries and an edge_list to store the processed data. To simplify our graph structure and analysis, we introduce virtual start and end nodes, which serve as placeholders for the beginning and end of the project timeline. These virtual nodes act as the common starting and ending points for all tasks in the project. By adding a virtual start node, we can easily connect it to all tasks that do not have any prerequisites, effectively establishing a single entry-point for the project. Similarly, the virtual end node is connected to all tasks that do not have any successors, providing a single exit point for the project. By incorporating virtual start and end nodes in our Python-based critical path analysis, we can more accurately represent the project structure and streamline the process of finding the critical path. See below figures for illustration. "
